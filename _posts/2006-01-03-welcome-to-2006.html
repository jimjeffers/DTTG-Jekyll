<p><a href="http://joshuaink.com/blog/590/the-f-bomb-redesigned-for-2006">John Oxton</a> welcomes us into 2006 with a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/oxton/81633943/">nice picture</a> of what we'll continue to see a lot more of in the new year. Shiny floors. I'm guilty of this as well but I'm not quite as bad.  I make no mention of any beta in <a href="http://www.ziptrac.com">my ziptrac logo</a>.</p>
<p>Either way I'm looking forward to more.  Should be fun for a while I haven't gotten sick of it all quite yet.</p>

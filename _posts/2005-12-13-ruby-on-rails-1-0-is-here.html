<p>Today "Ruby on Rails 1.0":http://www.rubyonrails.org/ was finally released.  There were two final release candidates that popped up over the last two weeks so I'm not surprised to see it here today.  But what is surprising is the entire redesign of the Rails website.  Check out "David's post":http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/articles/2005/12/13/rails-1-0-party-like-its-one-oh-oh to learn more about 1.0!</p>
<p>If you're interested in starting up a Rails application of your own I recommend looking into grabbing an account at "Site5":http://www.site5.com, "DreamHost":http://www.dreamhost.com, or "TextDrive":http://www.textdrive.com as they all offer stable shared hosting environments for Rails and should be upgrading their servers to 1.0 in the next couple of days if they haven't already!</p>

I'm going to be working on retheming this blog shortly so I'm looking for some good inspiration.  If I find anything I like I'll be sure to share it with you along with my two cents.  So with  that here's my first go:

"Ordered List":http://orderedlist.com/
This is the blog of Steve Smith who created the awesome "WP-Tiger-Admin":http://orderedlist.com/wordpress-plugins/wp-tiger-administration/ plugin.  His old blog was pretty slick but this new redesign really sets his apart.  I like the large font and simplistic layout; it makes the site very easy and enjoyable to read. I totally dig it.

<p>Ok so I'm having a slight problem building my CMS for a client.  I want to utilize the same model to handle the photos for their case studies as well as their services.  Each has their own model.  So the Photo model belongs to a Project or a Service.   But in reality it belongs to a project OR a service.  Thus I have a problem using acts_as_list.</p>
<pre name="code" class="ruby">
class Photo < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :service
  belongs_to :project

  acts_as_taggable
  acts_as_list :scope => :project_id

  file_column :image, :magick => { :versions => { "thumb" => "50x50", "medium" => "640x480>" } }
end
</pre>
<p>If I could do something like:</p>
<pre name="code" class="ruby">acts_as_list :scope => :project_id || :service_id</pre>
<p>
Then this would be a piece of cake but it's not that easy.  How would you solve this?  I know it's not that challenging.</p>

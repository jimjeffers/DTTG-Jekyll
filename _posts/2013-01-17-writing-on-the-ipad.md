  Physical keyboards are overrated.

One of the silliest things you'll hear about the iPad is that it doesn't have a physical keyboard. Ironically, I think all of those statements come from folks who haven't used an iPad for an extended period of time.

Most of my notes at conferences and other free writing I do happens on my iPad. It's an extremely easy and distraction free way to sit down and write.

I agree, the iPad is not the place I would go to edit code (though some may disagree), but for getting thoughts recorded into words, the iPad is definitely my tool of choice. Virtual keyboards work amazing and it's just one less thing I have to carry around or spend money on.

<p>I was just browsing around and noticed I finally come up first and fourth for my own name on Google! Now I have some SEO results actally worth bragging about right?Â  I mean it's gotta be a popular search term.  On another note I have totally discredited my name to the world.  I doubt the sarcasm initially registers as well.. sarcasm across Google.  What do you think?  Now I just need to claim Jimmy Jeffers and James Jeffers.  Then I'll have all bases covered.<br />

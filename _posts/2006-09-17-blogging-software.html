<p>I am growing very VERY <strong>VERY</strong> tired of wordpress comment spam!  Becuase it's so standardized and widespread it's an open target to these attacks.  Here's an analogy.. using wordpress instead of a homebaked or less popular blogging system is like using a PC instead of a mac when it comes to viruses!  Geez.  Oh well this is not meant to be a rant, rather I want suggestions. What do you guys suggest I switch to?</p>
<p>Presently, I'm considering Mephisto.  I don't like wordpress becuase I think it's too feature rich andheavy weight.  I want something lightweight that's easy for me to hack into and add my own code on.  I <strong>truly dislike the notion of upgrading.</strong>  Once I setup a blog the code is hacked apart by myself so much that upgrading just isn't an option.  So what are your thoughts?  What do you recommend?  Should I just build my own blogging software?  Should I try out Mephisto?  Are there any other decent CMS systems that are preferabbly Rails based?</p>

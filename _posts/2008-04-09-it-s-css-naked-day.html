<p>Today's the big day! I've turned off my style sheets in honor of <a href="http://naked.dustindiaz.com/">CSS naked day</a>!  Aside from the sIFR, which I'm not going to disable for this, you are seeing the pure semantic HTML markup of this site.  This ties into a series of posts <a href="http://donttrustthisguy.com/2008/04/04/write-html-that-means-something/">I started earlier this week on semantic HTML</a>.  More to come soon</p>

<h3>10 things we learned @ 37 signals</h3>

<h3>The great unknown.<br />
Who knows - who cares.</h3>
<ul>
	<li>focus on the now not the then.</li>
	<li>optimize for now.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Red flags</h3>
<ul>
	<li>need: puts a barrier up</li>
	<li>can't: negative thinking</li>
	<li>easy: something we normally use to describe other peoples jobs</li>
</ul>

<h3>Spot the chain reactions</h3>
<ul>
	<li>build projects that people are going to get things out of.</li>
	<li>don't worry about charging for things!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Target non consumers and non-consumption</h3>
<ul>
	<li>the markets that the entrenched players aren't properly targeting.</li>
	<li>minimize competition from the entrenched players</li>
</ul>

<h3>Question your work regularly</h3>
<ul><li>identify things that aren't changing behavior.</li></ul>

<h3>Read your product</h3>
<ul>
	<li>the words matter.</li>
	<li>bad copy is the greatest sin of web design.</li>
	<li>rewrite first, rewrite second</li>
</ul>

<h3>Err, on the side of simple</h3>
<ul>
	<li>always start with the easy way</li>
	<li>more often than not the easy way satisfies 80% of your needs</li>
	<li>get three things done in 1 week instead of one thing done in three weeks</li>
	<li>the longer you spend on development the less likely you are to launch it</li>
	<li>resist the urge to try to do more the next time around</li>
</ul>

<h3>Invest in what doesn't change</h3>
<ul><li>today and ten years from now</li></ul>

<h3>Follow the chefs</h3>
<ul>
	<li>lagasse</li>
	<li>batali</li>
	<li>flay</li>
	<li>building by sharing</li>
	<li>tell people what you know</li>
	<li>you reach a huge audience when you give away you're knowledge</li>
</ul>

<h3>Interruption is the biggest enemy of productivity</h3>
<ul>
	<li>when David moved to Chicago the less work they got done</li>
	<li>focus on passive communication</li>
</ul>

<h3>Road maps send you on the wrong direction</h3>
<ul>
	<li>lock you into a path - the past</li>
	<li>Its ok to think about the future but don't write it down</li>
	<li>do the write thing at the right time</li>
</ul>

<h3>Be clear in crisis</h3>
<ul>
	<li>be open public honest and responsive</li>
	<li>the web doesnt shutup just because you have</li>
	<li>of you don't deal with it the public will speculate it</li>
</ul>

<h3>Breakdown problems</h3>
<ul><li>When you make tiny decisions you can't make big mistakes</li></ul>

<h3>Make it matter</h3>
<ul><li>every decision you make should matter</li></ul>

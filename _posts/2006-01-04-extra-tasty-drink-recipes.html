<p>I recently became aware of <a href="http://www.extratasty.com">extratasty.com</a>; a website that is basically the <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a> equivalent for drink recipes.  The best part about the site is how well done and professional it is.  The company developing the site,  skinnycorp, has done an extraordinary job illustrating how you can create an extremely valuable resource for pretty much any topic of content matter.</p>
<p>My favorite part about the site is the quote in the top right corner: <em>"You're watching skinnyCorp make this site LIVE!  Email us with your wtf's."</em> That's classic.</p>

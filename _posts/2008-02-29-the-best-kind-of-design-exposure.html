<p>Yesterday I was greeted by fantastic news! <a href="http://www.ndesign-studio.com/" rel="friend">Nick La</a> has selected this site to be featured in the <a href="http://BestWebGallery.com">Best Web Gallery</a>!  Oh and did I mention that my traffic has shot through the roof!</p>

<h3>What is the Best Web Gallery?</h3>

<p>If you're familiar with sites like <a href="http://stylegala.com">StyleGala</a> or <a href="http://cssremix.com/">CSS Remix</a>, then you've probably heard of <a href="http://bestwebgallery.com">Best Web Gallery</a> or sites like it.  I found that Nick's site has the best frequency of updates with quality sites which is why his site is the CSS Gallery I goto almost exclusively for design inspiration.  I submitted <a href="/" rel="home">DontTrustThisGuy.com</a> over the weekend and surprisingly made it into this weeks update!</p>

<h3>Some Much Needed Traffic</h3>

<p>This site is not very well known so I average only about 40-70 visits per day.  Yesterday's publicity shot my traffic out of the water! Almost 800 visits in one day!  Needless to say I hope at least a few new people to the site stick around for more upcoming posts.</p>

<h3>A Recap of the Site Design</h3>

<p>What you can't tell from the surface from this design is the technology under the hood.  I took this site as a chance to experiment with extensive implementations of Microformats and also took advantage of some new features in CSS3.  So if you're interested in seeing just how I did it check out my article '<a href="http://donttrustthisguy.com/2008/01/01/a-refreshed-design-for-2008/">A Refreshed Design for 2008.</a>'</p>

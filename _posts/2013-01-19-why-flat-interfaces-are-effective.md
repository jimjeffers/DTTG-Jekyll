excerpt:
  Redirecting attention from the physical appearance of a UI and directing it toward how it actually works will result in better designs.

If you've ever browsed [dribbble](http://dribbble.com) you've probably left inspired with a lot of icon and user interface ideas. The overwhelming majority of shots you'll see trend toward [hyper](http://dribbble.com/shots/902906-Travel-Magazine?list=popular&offset=44)[real](http://dribbble.com/shots/902104-Melting-Reflections?list=popular&offset=7). That's not a bad thing at all, but it does tend to show where most of the designers effort is being utilized.

In stark contrast to the many pristine hyper real interfaces we've seen are flat interfaces. The first app with a flat UI that really struck my attention was [Scorekeeper](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXqXpwyBI1k). While the interface looks deceptively simple, while using the app you will find the interface to be incredibly clever. The designer took time to focus on what he wanted to communicate and convey those messages clearly. Color, sound, timing, transitions, meaning derived from icons, etc.. 

In short, the removal of bevels, textures, and shadows liberates your mind to focus on what really matters in an interface -- communication. Designers are liberated from obsessing over the opacity of a given texture, the strength of a drop shadow, or the amount of pixels used to show a beveled edge. Designers of flat interfaces are only left to focus on the questions that really matter: What is simple and complex to interpret in the interface? Does the UI provide the appropriate provide feedback to communicate events to the user? What elements can be stripped away or need to be added in?

Flat interfaces have a very clear advantage when it comes to the refinement of elements. While introducing or removing any element from a UI will likely require many considerations in other portions of an app's UI, the painstaking time investment of implementing the hyper-real element is stripped from the decision making process. If a designer has spent days obsessing over an incredibly cool and glossing loading interface, it may be a difficult decision to remove it from the project once requirements change or they realize that loading can be done in the background and thus should be communicated in a manner that doesn't block the UI with big glowing progress bar.

Offsetting the attention directed towards manipulating the visual appearance of interface elements will more often than not lead to a better quality application. Because the designer will spend more time devoting their effort towards the design decisions that really matter.

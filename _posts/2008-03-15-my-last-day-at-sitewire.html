<p>For the past year and seven months I have been happily employed at <a href="http://www.sitewire.net">Sitewire</a>, an interactive marketing agency in Tempe.  I spent my time there initially as their front end architect and flash developer but eventually fell into the role of lead designer.  The experience has been great.</p>

<h3>Some of the Highlights</h3>

<p>I can't recommend <a href="http://sitewire.net">Sitewire</a> highly enough for their people.  Everyone there is absolutely great and I've endured many great friendships during my time at the company.  The most enjoyable projects I got to work on for the company were our internal marketing efforts.  Assisting Lacey in the video shoot and designing a slick flash application to showcase them; randomly improvising a photo shoot and working alongside <a href="http://visualintent.net">Mike Campbell
</a> to redesign the <a href="http://donttrustthisguy.com/2007/09/20/a-new-face-for-sitewire/">Sitewire website</a> last summer.</p>

<h3>A New Direction</h3>

<p>However, time has taken it's toll and things have changed.  I've found a more exciting opportunity with the super cool folks at <a href="http://integrumtech.com">Integrum Technologies</a>. I'm leaving the ad agency life to work in the realm of web applications and joining a team that practices an agile development process. I'm very excited with this move and look forward to sharing some of the cool stuff Integrum puts out in the future.</p>

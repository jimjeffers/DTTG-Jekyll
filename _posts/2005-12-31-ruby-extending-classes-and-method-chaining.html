<p>Once you start fooling around with the Ruby language you really do get hooked on just how powerful it is.  I was disappointed when I first found out that the String.capitalize function only formatted the very first letter of a string to a capital letter as this is undesirable when you are formatting something like a street address.  Not to worry though, extending the String class is easy in ruby and writing the function to do it requires only one line of code!</p>
<pre name="code" class="ruby">
class String
  def capitalize_each
    self.split(" ").each{|word| word.capitalize!}.join(" ")
  end
  def capitalize_each!
    replace capitalize_each
  end
end

puts "hello WORLD!".capitalize_each #=> "Hello World!"

s = "6825 W. GALVESTON ST."
puts s.capitalize #=> "6825 w. galveston st."
puts s.capitalize_each #=> "6825 W. Galveston St."
puts s #=> "6825 W. GALVESTON ST."

s.capitalize_each!
puts s #=> "6825 W. Galveston St."
</pre>
<p>Pretty nifty eh?  If any one can show me how to rewrite the function as a destructive function please comment because I'm stumped.</p>
<h3>Update:</h3>
<p><strong>Thanks to Assaf's comment</strong> I was able to write the destructive version of capitalize each.</p>

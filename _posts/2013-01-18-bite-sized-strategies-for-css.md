  Breaking down selectors into bite-sized morsels of functional goodness is key to front-end success!

Practicing restraint with the complexity of CSS selectors is important to building a more maintainable project. Practicing restraint in the rules you write are equally important. It's really tempting to write specific selectors to query a specific set of elements and then pile on a stack of CSS rules. But doing so creates two problems:

1. You can't easily re-use your styles. In effect, you need to come up with an alternate selector that you tack on to the existing rule to apply it to other DOM objects.
2. If you need to provide variations of an object you'll create a new rule which will likely need additional rules to undo changes in the original rule.

The solution to these problems is bite-sized CSS. This involves creating specific classes to describe specific attributes you want to re-apply on different objects. As an example lets create a simple CSS framework for buttons used throughout the UI of a web application.

Let's say we have a call to action that looks like a big red button with uppercase text. A bad practice would be to use a very specific selector and a large set of rules:

{% highlight css %}
/* BAD */
#content > div#primary > section#call-to-action a {
  background-color: red;
  border-radius: 5px;
  font-weight: bold;
  display: block;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  margin: 0 1em;
  padding: 0.25em 0.5em;
  text-color: white;
  text-decoration: none;  
}
{% endhighlight %}

But what happens when we want to apply a similar button style to our confirm and cancel buttons used throughout the size?

{% highlight css %}
/* WORSE! */
#content > div#primary > section#call-to-action a,
#content form input.confirm,
#content form input.secondary {
  ...
}

/* Overwriting rules we just applied... */
#content form input.confirm,
#content form input.secondary {
  background: blue;
  text-transform: capitalize;
}

/* Overwriting rules we just overwrote! */
#content form input.secondary {
  background: grey;
  font-weight: normal;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Bad habits like this one force us to work against ourselves. We'll wind up no better off than where we started. Each additional use case for an item with a similar style results in us returning to the CSS to extend and create additional selectors and rules rather than simply re-applying them across elements.

The solution is to use name-spaced classes that can be combined to achieve the desired effect:

{% highlight css %}
/* GOOD */
.bitesized-btn {
  background: blue;
  border-radius: 5px;
  display: block;
  text-color: white;
  text-decoration: none;  
}

.bitesized-btn-default {
  font-weight: bold;
}

.bitesized-btn-secondary {
  background: grey;
}

.bitesized-btn-priority {
  background: red;
  font-weight: bold;
  text-transform: uppercase;
}

.bitesized-btn-standalone {
  margin: 0 1em;
  padding: 0.25em 0.5em;
}
{% endhighlight %}

With a set of bite-sized classes to manage the presentation of our buttons we can simply add classes to applicable portions of our markup without creating additional complexity in our CSS.

{% highlight html %}
<!-- Call to Action -->
<section id="call-to-action">
  ...
  <a class="bitesized-btn bitesized-btn-priority bitesized-btn-standalone">â€¦</a>
</section>
{% endhighlight %}

And then later on when we have a form with dual buttons:

{% highlight html %}
<!-- Form Buttons -->
<form>
  ...
  <input class="bitesized-btn bitesized-btn-default"
    value="Save" type="submit"/>
  <input class="bitesized-btn bitesized-btn-secondary"
    value="Cancel" type="button"/>
</form>
{% endhighlight %}

There are two important things to note:

1. The type of element we use no longer matters. We could use these classes on an anchor, input, or whatever DOM element we wanted.
2. The class names are still semantic. They add value to our markup. Yes it is implied that each class is applying a specific variation to the appearance, but we're using meaningful names to do so. We aren't using classes named button-red or button-blue. We have primary and secondary intents now clearly labeled throughout the site. If we want to add any specific functionality to our project with javascript we can easily query the default action for any given perform just by querying `$(".bitesized-btn-default")`.
3. The prefix `bitesized-` could be replaced with any name you wanted to use for your project. For example, google's maia CSS framework prefixes with the `maia-` namespace.

Approaching CSS in a bite-sized approach provides a clear pattern for success. Each additional use case provides a reason to extend our css framework in a meaningful way. Rather than introducing more complexity, we now have a pattern to both solve our problems and render our CSS framework more powerful.

<p>Tonight I popped up my favorite album from last year, <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=264075937&s=143441" title="Get the Blakes on iTunes">The Blakes self titled album</a>, and to my surprise I saw some new cover art come up in the "More from this artist" box in iTunes.  I didn't hear of a new CD coming from them and indeed I was faked out.  It looks like they got picked up by a label due to their popularity and thus have been given the resources to reproduce their debut album in higher quality.  If you already have the Blakes original album this duplicate album is worth picking up as you'll get 4 new tracks from them.  But even better, the entire album now sounds much more vibrant.  This is some high-def Seattle indie grunge rock.  Don't miss it!   My favorite album of 2006 is now my favorite album of 2007.</p>

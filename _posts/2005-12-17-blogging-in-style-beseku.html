<p>I recently stumbled across another <a href="http://www.beseku.com">excellent blog</a>.  In this case, it's a blogfolio, showcasing portfolio of work in a blog format, for Ben Sekulowicz-Barclay.  I think Ben has don an excellent job keeping it simple and clear.  I love the lime green / dark grey / white color scheme but what makes this site really interesting is the fact that there's no navigation whatsoever.  No tags, no category listing, no archive lists. Just content.  I really like it because his design makes it work.  It only takes a few minutes to realize how easy it is to find anything on his site.</p>

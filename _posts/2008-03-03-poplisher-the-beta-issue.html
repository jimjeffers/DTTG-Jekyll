<p>My good friend <a href="http://mmsullivan.com" rel="friend">Mike Sullivan</a> has just provided an invite to his new online publishing community <a href="http://poplisher.com">Poplisher</a>.  Mike is a veteran in the publishing industry and is seeking to create a unique platform that merges online media with print media in interesting ways.</p>

<p>The service describes itself as: <em><a href="http://poplisher.com">Poplisher</a> is a tool to discover and select the best stories on the web.  Popular articles from independent writers will be published in professionally designed and distributed magazines.  Print power to the people.</em></p>

<p>I would highly encourage any bloggers out there interested to sign up and participate in the <a href="http://poplisher.com">beta issue</a>!</p>

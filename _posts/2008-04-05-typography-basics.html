<p>Robert Bringhurst's book "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Typographic-Style-Robert-Bringhurst/dp/0881791326">The Elements of Typographic Style</a>" is an invaluable resource to any print or web designer currently practicing. I purchased this book a while back, and now sitting in the airport after SxSWi, I've finally gotten a chance to examine it in detail. Here are some important teachings I've gotten so far.</p>

<h3>Horizontal Rhythm</h3>

<p>Line length is critical in print and web design. Perhaps the greatest rationale for arguing against a fluid-width web layout come from the general rules of thumbed defined in Robert's book.</p>

<p>The <strong>measure</strong>, or the line-length, is fundamental to the readability of your text:</p>

<ul>
	<li>In general a satisfactory <strong>measure</strong> is anywhere between 45 and 75 characters long.</li>
	<li>A 66-character line measure is widely regarded as ideal.</li>
	<li>For multiple columns, a measure of 40-50 characters tends to be satisfactory.</li>
	<li>You should not go below a 40 character measure when text is justified.</li>
</ul>

<p>Choosing <strong>ragged</strong> lines or applying <strong>justification</strong> can affect the structure and feel of your piece:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If both styles of alignment suit the piece, choose ragged.</li>
	<li>San-serif fonts tend to look better using ragged lines.</li>
	<li>Mono-spaced fonts always look better ragged.</li>
	<li>Justification of text in columns with shorter measures can lead to over-hyphenation.</li>
</ul>

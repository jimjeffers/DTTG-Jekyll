<p>Tomorrow morning I will be waking up early to head out to the polls and put in my two cents on how I think things ought to be as I see it.  After all it is my right.  Personally, I haven't been very unhappy with the way things have been going.  Since Bush was re-elected I became totally disillusioned in our society as a whole, not because he is a republican but because of what he has done.</p>

<p>Often, I wonder why the majority of us can just sit back and support the leadership that has driven us into the disastrous situation we are in today.  What is it that people care about?  Obviously, some things must matter more to many of us than the loss of life, which has all happened for no legitimate cause or reason in Iraq.  Is it preventing the gays from getting married?  Is it to keep taxes low?  Is it about shutting down abortion clinics?  Is it to support campaign issues tied to religious values?  I would like to think all of us went out to vote to protect our rights.  I would hope we all took the big picture into consideration and looked at where the world is going and what we can do on an individual basis to improve it.  But is that too much to ask for?</p>

<p>Many of my peers today seem focused on working, earning, and prospering.  Money and material possessions are a key motivation amongst many.  This is the result of the capitalistic society we have been born into in this country.  I appreciate it in many ways but I also am disgusted by it at the same time.  I think pure capitalism is inhumane.  Think about companies like Wal-Mart that have become a prime example of capitalistic thinking in full strength.  Making money is important, but the more you take the less everyone else gets.  Where do you draw the line?  When does it become inhumane to to earn that additional buck or two?  What's the human cost doing so?  What's the worldly cost of doing so?</p>

<p>I guess what I'm trying to say is that by our methodology we subscribe to a more cold approach to life in general.  We THINK we want a world where people tell us all of the chips are in place for us to be successful.  If we push harder than the rest we'll get what others could not in life.  But I don't think we have to live in a dog eat dog world where we let healthcare run out of control and let the less fortunate sit on the street.  Many citizens simply 'play the game'.  Work to spend. Work to spend. Work to spend.  While my thoughts have been unclear throughout this particular writing; the main principle I had in mind while writing it was this: When you think about what you want to do, when you think about where you want to see the world headed, when you think about the changes we can make in our society... do not be influenced by the popular motto 'Play to win.'  Instead.. play to improve, but above all, play to give.  Learn from the wealthiest people in our society.  Remember if you are fortunate enough to earn a great amount of money you have a gift many don't.  Be sure to take care of those who need it most.  With that mind set I think we all may make clearer decisions that have more value than purely that of short-sighted self interests.</p>

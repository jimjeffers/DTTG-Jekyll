<p>Well now all of my current sites are hosted on Dreamhost.  The only way to go from here is to get my own box later on down the road.  Since I had to upload some files all over again I figured I'd install a new version of the <a href="http://www.huddledmasses.org/2005/10/03/textile-plugin-26-released/">textile 2.6</a> plugin that allowed support for the <a href="http://dev.wp-plugins.org/wiki/GeshiSyntaxColorer">Geshi</a> syntax highlighting engine.  Let's do a quick test to see if it worked.</p>
<pre name="code" class="ruby">
def hello<br />
  puts "hello world"<br />
end
<p>3.times do hello<br />
</p></pre>
<h4>Update</h4>
<p>Obviously the Geshi system is getting cleaned up by the Textile plugin.  I'm still confused as to why but at this point I may just have to live without Geshi becuase I already know I can't live without Textile!</p>

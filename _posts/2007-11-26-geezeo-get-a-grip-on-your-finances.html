<p>I run my own personal business and have a day job.  So I have double the fun when it comes to monitoring my checking and savings accounts.  On top of that I have credit cards for myself and my business, an auto loan, and a student loan.  Managing all of that can be pretty hectic.  Fortunately, I've discovered an  awesome free web 2.0 service called <a href="http://www.geezeo.com" target="_blank">Geezeo</a> and all I can say is this thing frickin rocks!</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Here's what I did in 15 minutes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add my credit card accounts</li>
<li>Add my personal checking/savings</li>
<li>Add my business checking/savings</li>
<li>Add my auto loan</li>
<li>Categorized (via tagging) all of my expenses for the last 30 days</li>
<li>Set monthly goals for coffee, food, transportation, and entertainment expenses</li>
<li>Saw how much I was within or overshot them this month.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's a lot of stuff in a short amount of time.  The best part is the legwork is done now.  The account and transaction data auto update.  And <a href="http://www.geezeo.com" target="_blank">Geezeo</a> remembers places you shopped at for auto tagging.  So if you are like me and you purchase everything on plastic all of your expenses are logged and categorized.  Well, except for the occasional unique purchase that confuses <a href="http://www.geezeo.com" target="_blank">Geezeo</a>!  And that means I can just log in anytime and in less than a minute I can see how much over or under budget I am this month for any particular type of spending.  This is absolutely incredible stuff.  I highly recommend trying it if you aren't using any sort of tool already.  <a href="http://www.geezeo.com" target="_blank">Geezeo</a> makes managing your finances fun and easy.</p>
<p>Well less of fun and more entertaining / fascinating / cartoony / and interesting.  Good deal!</p>

At this year's <a href="http://www.sxsw.com">SXSW</a> I didn't feel like pulling out my laptop to take notes.  Instead, I mastered the iPhone keyboard and jotted down some quick notes from the more interesting sessions.  Here are my notes from Kathy Sierra's excellent talk on helping your users kick ass.

<h3>20 Things You Could Do To Help Your Users Kick Ass</h3>
<strong>How do we help our users kick ass?</strong>

We don't want the user talking about us or our product. We want them talking about their experience.

The hi-res user experience: <em>Change the way you view your world.</em>

Nueroscience: <em>Environment can inhibit brain growth.</em>

Difference between natural and acquired talents.
<ul>
	<li>It's not about natural talent its about the ability to take the time to practice.</li>
	<li>You just need to put in the time.</li>
	<li>You need to give them shortcuts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>"We need a rage to master."</h3>
<strong>1. Use telepathy</strong>
<ul>
	<li>it started with a monkey.</li>
	<li>two flavors of mirror neurons</li>
	<li>Just being able to read expressions. It's like you're simulating what they're thinking.</li>
	<li>For visualization - if you imagine seeing what you would see if you did it.</li>
</ul>
<strong>2. Serendipity</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Psychic shuffle</li>
	<li>people believe the random selection on the iPod shuffle know what they wanted to hear next.</li>
</ul>
<strong>3. Add dog ears effect</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Attention to detail</li>
	<li>Fluidity</li>
</ul>
<strong>4. Use Joy</strong>

<strong>5. Inspire first-person language.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>how can we build our products so that users talk about their experiences and not the product I company?</li>
</ul>
<strong>7. Easter eggs</strong>

<strong>8. Tools for evangelism</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Twitter in plain English video on youtube</li>
	<li>help users defend this "totally lame waste of time"</li>
	<li>Sleeptracker</li>
</ul>
<strong>9. Exercise the brain</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Increase the performance of your brain?</li>
	<li>Exercise</li>
</ul>
<strong>10. Help people exercise their body</strong>

<strong>11. Give them super powers</strong>

<strong>13. Speeds their knowledge acquisition</strong>
<ul>
	<li>what can we do to keep people pushing forward</li>
	<li>learn to do knowledge acquisition</li>
	<li>give people patterns</li>
</ul>
<strong>15. Help with the reinvestment of mental resources into new problems</strong>
<em>Speaking of twitter - we have to give people a chance to focus</em>
<ul>
	<li>Attention offsets</li>
	<li>Maybe a meditation retreat</li>
</ul>
<strong>16. Make users heros</strong>
<ul>
	<li>No dumb questions</li>
	<li>No dumb answers</li>
	<li>Teach the community how to ask good questions.</li>
</ul>
<strong>17. Do NOT insist on "inclusivity"</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Jargon is good</li>
	<li>Passionate users talk differently</li>
</ul>
<strong>18. Practice seductive opacity.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Brains like mystery</li>
</ul>
<strong>19. Atoms are not old school</strong>

<strong>19.5 Do what this guy does</strong> - in reference to <a href="http://tv.winelibrary.com/">Gary Vaynerchuk</a>.

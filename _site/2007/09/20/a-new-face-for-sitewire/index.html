  <section id="body">
    <p>I'm proud today to announce that we have finally finished putting enough spit and polish onto the new <a href="http://www.sitewire.net">Sitewire</a> web page that it's ready for public attention.  I handled all of the design, flash work, and html/css development while balancing other projects brought to me within Sitewire.  The experience has been hectic at times but overall unique.  For example, during the design phase of the project I wasn't allowed to work in the office so I worked remotely from nearby coffee shops around town.   Even more interesting - we rented truckloads of photography and lighting equipment and converted our office kitchen into a makeshift photo studio to do a staff-wide photo shoot as we didn't have the time or the budget to accomplish at a professional studio.  </p>
<p>A lot of things happened simultaneously during this project.  Design concepts and brainstorming were being developed the same time as messaging and copy.  This made both phases of the project a little less efficient from a time perspective but much more collaborative as both design inspired new copy and new copy inspired new ideas for design.  Though things felt a bit hectic at times, I'm fairly pleased with the final result.  The site is a bit heavy, but overall it's pretty solid.  So with that being said I present to you the new <a href="http://www.sitewire.net" title="Sitewire">Sitewire.com</a>.  Take a look and share your thoughts whenever you get a chance.</p>

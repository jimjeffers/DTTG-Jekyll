    <p>I wouldn&#8217;t say this list is really exciting by any means. But I thought I&#8217;d share the languages I&#8217;m continuing to focus on this year:</p>

<h2 id='javascript__coffeescript'>Javascript / Coffeescript</h2>

<p>Javascript is quickly becoming one of my favorite programming languages. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;m using more and more each year. Also, I find the organization and workflow for client-side Javascript projects to be a weak point for many of the development projects I contribute to. The rails &#8220;asset-pipeline&#8221; is definitely a crutch and though it&#8217;s good enough in my opinion it&#8217;s only useful while working within rails projects. This year, a focus on workflow, project organization, and testing will be key. It&#8217;s really easy to build something in javascript but it&#8217;s not common to see people building things to last. And there&#8217;s still way too much spaghetti code being flung around sites.</p>

<h2 id='objectivec__ios_development'>Objective-C / iOS Development</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m still incredibly excited to work in objective-C. While my own App Store adventure has turned out to be lackluster, I had great fun co-developing and designing Idea Bucket. Fortunately, that experience provided two consulting opportunities involving native iOS development. I find the platform to be really challenging in a good way. Testing, maintainability, and organization will be my focus here this year.</p>

<h2 id='ruby__rails'>Ruby / Rails</h2>

<p>I admittedly did very little work in Ruby last year. In fact, I&#8217;d say less than 10% of my income was from Rails based projects last year. That being said, I still find ruby to be one of the languages I&#8217;m most comfortable programming and testing in. Ruby 2.0 and Rails 4.0 should both be released this year bringing a fresh sense of excitement to working on these projects once again.</p>

<h2 id='arduino__rasberry_pi'>Arduino / Rasberry Pi</h2>

<p>Last year I bought a couple of kits for arduino and started to attend weekly hardware hacking meetings. That sort of thing fell off my radar after I got caught up with work. This year, I really don&#8217;t want that to be the case. This week is actually the first week I&#8217;m going to meet up with a friend (creating a &#8216;helping relationship&#8217; in behavior design) to start what I hope becomes a weekly / monthly endeavor into playing around with hardware and code.</p>

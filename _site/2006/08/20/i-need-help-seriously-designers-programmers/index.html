  <section id="body">
    <p>My little company <a href="http://www.sumocreations.com">Sumo Creations</a> is in need of massive help I've got several commitments on my plate and a biggie next month!  Right now I'm literally a one man show I can't keep it up I wish I could or else I'd be rich.  I'm focused on building a simple company that produces high quality results however with that being said let me explain my offer.</p>
<h2>What I'm looking for...</h2>
<p>I'm not looking for a lot of people just a handful of skilled individuals.  Here are the ingredients to my cookbook:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CSS/XHTML Guru</strong></li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Much of my work always requires this.  I'm very good at CSS/XHTML so I have high expectations here.  If you're comfortable converting PSD's to CSS templates let's talk.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>An Edgy and Skilled Designer that's got a Edge!</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>I don't care how glossy or web 2.0 you can make a page look.  I care about how usable it is and functional it is.  I'm looking for someone who has a good eye for font, placement, and structure.  You should have a good eye for detail.  If you are interested reply to this post via comment.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Ruby Developer (Rails Specific)</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>I'm looking for a quality rails developer.  If you love ruby and you can fly on rails I just need to see a couple of snippets and may ask you for a work sample.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Compensation</h2>
<p>I honestly dislike people asking me what my rate is as a designer/developer.  I understand as a freelancer you typically make more money on a project per project basis where I can know clear in advance I can a lot this much to an individual to perform a given task.  This often works out in the contractors favor where I might offer to pay you $550 to do a PSD/XHTLM conversion that might take you 8-10 hours as opposed to me paying you $40/hr.  If you do prefer hourly don't bother submitting bids.  I have predefined rates for you if you are interested let me know:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CSS/XHTML Guru:</strong> $35/hr</li>
<li><strong>Web Designer:</strong> $40/hr</li>
<li><strong>Ruby Developer:</strong> $45/hr</li>
</ul>
<h2>Contractors Only</h2>
<p>I'm not at the point yet where I'm ready to take on full on employees..  I need to restructure my tax status from an LLC/SP to an LLC/S-Corp so until then I'm only hiring out via W-9 but you will be well compensated just be sure you save a good amount to cover your self-employment tax.</p>
<h2>Telecommuting is totally cool!</h2>
<p>I don't need to meet you in person.  I got my first job as a Flash designer when I was only 15 working for a company in Texas while I lived in Arizona.  My only communication to the company was over the phone!  You are welcome to meet me in person anytime though!</p>
<h2>All in all.</h2>
<p>I'm really pleased business is going well for my company.  All of my work has been through word of mouth and personal selling.  I have always been so busy I never even had time to build the site for Sumo itself but if I have a few good people this won't be a problem and I expect business to boom even more once our site is launched and after I wrap up my projects for this next month.</p>
<p>I've been doing this work for a LONNNGG Time.  I expect quality!  Show me you know your stuff.   I might request a short work sample to see how you tackle a task.  If you are interested just drop a comment, express your interest, share any links, and include your email address.  I'll get in touch.</p>
